## Making Rigorous Conclusions {.unnumbered}

In this part we introduce modelling and statistical inference for making data-based conclusions.
We discuss building, interpreting, and selecting models, visualizing interaction effects, and prediction and model validation.
Statistical inference is introduced from a simulation based perspective, and the Central Limit Theorem is discussed very briefly to lay the foundation for future coursework in statistics.
