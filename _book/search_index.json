Specifically we cover fundamentals of data and data visualization, confounding variables, and Simpson’s paradox as well as the concept of tidy data, data import, data cleaning, and data curation. We end the unit with web scraping and introduce the idea of iteration in preparation for the next unit. Also in this unit students are introduced to the toolkit: R, RStudio, R Markdown, Git, and GitHub. 2.1 Visualising data Unit 2 - Deck 1: Data and visualisation Slides Video Unit 2 - Deck 2: Visualising data with ggplot2 Slides Video R4DS :: Chp 3 - Data visualization Unit 2 - Deck 3: Visualising numerical data Slides Video IMS :: Chp 4 - Exploring numerical data::: Unit 2 - Deck 4: Visualising categorical data Slides Video IMS :: Chp 5 - Exploring categorical data 2.2 Wrangling and tidying data Unit 2 - Deck 5: Tidy data Slides Video JSS :: Tidy data Unit 2 - Deck 6: Grammar of data wrangling Slides Video Unit 2 - Deck 7: Working with a single data frame Slides Video R4DS :: Chp 5 - Data transformation Unit 2 - Deck 8: Working with multiple data frames Slides Video R4DS :: Chp 13 - Relational data Unit 2 - Deck 9: Tidying data Slides Video R4DS :: Chp 12 - Tidy data 2.3 Importing and recoding data Unit 2 - Deck 10: Data types Slides Source Video Unit 2 - Deck 11: Data classes Slides Source Video R4DS :: Chp 15 - Factors Unit 2 - Deck 12: Importing data Slides Video R4DS :: Chp 11 - Data import Unit 2 - Deck 13: Recoding data Slides Video R4DS :: Sec 16.1 - 16.3 - Dates and times 2.4 Communicating data science results effectively Unit 2 - Deck 14: Tips for effective data visualization Slides Video IMS :: Chp 6 - Applications: Explore Unit 2 - Deck 15: Scientific studies and confounding Slides Video IMS :: Chp 2 - Study design Unit 2 - Deck 16: Simpson’s paradox Slides Video Unit 2 - Deck 17: Doing data science Slides Video R4DS :: Chp 7 - Exploratory data analysis 2.5 Web scraping and programming Unit 2 - Deck 18: Web scraping Slides Video Unit 2 - Deck 19: Scraping top 250 movies on IMDB Slides Video Unit 2 - Deck 20: Web scraping considerations Slides Video Unit 2 - Deck 21: Functions Slides Video R4DS :: Chp 19 - Functions Unit 2 - Deck 22: Iteration Slides Video R4DS :: Chp 20 - Iteration "],["ethics.html", "Chapter 3 Data science ethics 3.1 Misrepresentation 3.2 Data privacy 3.3 Algorithmic bias", " Chapter 3 Data science ethics This unit touches on data science ethics, specifically on issues of misrepresentation of data and results, data privacy, and algorithmic bias.

We discuss building, interpreting, and selecting models, visualizing interaction effects, and prediction and model validation. Statistical inference is introduced from a simulation based perspective, and the Central Limit Theorem is discussed very briefly to lay the foundation for future coursework in statistics. 4.1 Modelling data Unit 4 - Deck 1: The language of models Slides Video Unit 4 - Deck 2: Fitting and interpreting models Slides Video IMS :: Chp 7 - Linear regression with a single predictor Unit 4 - Deck 3: Modelling nonlinear relationships Slides Video Unit 4 - Deck 4: Models with multiple predictors Slides Video IMS :: Chp 8 - Linear regression with multiple predictors Unit 4 - Deck 5: More models with multiple predictors Slides Video 4.2 Classification and model building Unit 4 - Deck 6: Logistic regression Slides Video IMS :: Chp 9 - Logistic regression Unit 4 - Deck 7: Prediction and overfitting Slides Video tidymodels :: Build a model Unit 4 - Deck 8: Feature engineering Slides Video tidymodels :: Preprocess your data with recipes 4.3 Model validation Unit 4 - Deck 9: Cross validation Slides Video tidymodels :: Evaluate your model with resampling 4.4 Uncertainty quantification Unit 4 - Deck 10: Quantifying uncertainty Slides Video Unit 4 - Deck 11: Bootstrapping Slides Video IMS :: Chp 12 - Confidence intervals with bootstrapping Unit 4 - Deck 12: Hypothesis testing Slides IMS :: Chp 11 - Hypothesis testing with randomization Unit 4 - Deck 13: Inference overview Slides "],["looking-forward.html", "Chapter 5 Looking further 5.1 Text analysis 5.2 Interactive web apps 5.3 Machine learning 5.4 Bayesian inference", " Chapter 5 Looking further In the last unit we present a series of modules such as interactive reporting and visualization with Shiny, text analysis, machine learning, and Bayesian inference. These are independent modules that educators can choose to include in their introductory data science curriculum depending on how much time they have left in the semester. Note that the slides in this unit are a bit more sparse than the others, and much of the content is delivered as live coding sessions. 5.1 Text analysis Unit 5 - Deck 1: Text analysis Slides Video Unit 5 - Deck 2: Comparing texts Slides Video 5.2 Interactive web apps Unit 5 - Deck 3: Interactive web apps Slides Video Unit 5 - Deck 4: Interactive data visualisation Slides Unit 5 - Deck 5: Interactive data visualisation and reporting Slides 5.3 Machine learning Unit 5 - Deck 6: Machine learning Slides Video 5.4 Bayesian inference Unit 5 - Deck 7: Bayesian inference Slides "],["computing.html", "Access", " Access To access computing resources for the introductory data science courses offered by the Duke University Department of Statistical Science, go to the Duke Container Manager website, cmgr.oit.duke.edu/containers.

Under this heading you’ll find an entry called Container Manager (CMGR Coursework Containers). If the status shows something other than Operational, this means there is a known incident with the containers. Use your course discussion forum to report the issue. If the status shows Operational, this means the system is expected to be working. Check your internet connection, try opening the container in a different web browser, and if need be, restart your computer to ensure a fresh new connection. If the issue still persists, try restarting the cotainer. Lastly, if the issue is still unresolved, file ticket by filling out the Qualtrics form here. If there’s an imminent deadline, also consider posting on the course discussion forum.
